["Aerospace Systems Design Laboratory The Development and Evaluation of a Low- Cost Building Occupancy Estimation System Kendeda Micro Grant Symposium – April 18, 2023 Undergraduate Researchers: Alex Lomis and Devi Patel Research Advisor: Dr. Jung-Ho Lewe ","Alex Lomis This project sought to develop a low-cost, non-intrusive, and highly-scalable building occupancy sensor capable of detecting bi- directional motion at accessways. 2 Project Statement ","Alex Lomis This data is useful for the efficient utilization of building resources, and allows building operations to operate proactively rather than reactively. More data, from affordable and reliable sensors, is critical for characterizing building efficiency. 3 Project Motivation ","Future Steps Alex Lomis 4 Development Process Data Visualization Cellular IoT Literature Review Architectures Prototyping Validation Algorithms 1. People counting is an open-ended goal 1. Many valid solutions and methods discovered through literature and market reviews 2. Accuracy is important, but can be sacrificed slightly to achieve low-cost 1. The goal is not to make the most accurate system, but one that does the job and is cheap 2. Decide on an architecture, prototype, validate and repeat for the best solution 3. Reliability is important – how do we make sure these systems operate independently of location, Wi-Fi, or conditions? 1. Utilizing cellular communication and web-based visualization tools ","Architectures Next Steps Alex Lomis 5 Architecture Choices Data Vis. Cellular IoT Literature Review Prototyping Validation Algorithm Utilizing the understanding of current systems and methods, Ultrasonic and IR TOF sensors were selected as possible distance estimation tools. • Each system has its own tradeoffs, so prototypes were developed for both The VL53L0X Sensor records the short duration time between when a pulse of infrared light is released and when it returns. Has built-in crosstalk rejection. The HC-SR04 Sensor records the short duration time between when a pulse of ultrasonic frequency sound is emitted and when it returns.

Cellular IoT Literature Review Validation Algorithm • An IR TOF system was developed to allow algorithm development • This test-bed system read sensor values and plotted them in real-time for qualitative visualization • Mounts above a doorway, facing downwards, with 0, 15, and 30 degree outward angled sensors ","Validation Prototyping Architectures Next Steps Devi Patel 7 Validation Data Vis. Cellular IoT Literature Review Algorithm Testing revealed that the crosstalk issues present in the ultrasonic system made it too noisy for use. The IR system produced a clean signal with very clear transit direction. Ultrasonic Infrared ","Alex Lomis 8 Refined Hardware - Design • In parallel with the development of a robust counting algorithm, a more refined version of the hardware prototype was produced. • It uses a dedicated printed circuit board to decrease hardware size, and improve manufacturability • Has an on-board battery to be more resistant to power failures • Uses a new microcontroller, one that connects wirelessly over 4G-LTE or Wi-Fi • This special microcontroller and a basic overview of the 4G backend system will be discussed later ","Alex Lomis 9 Refined Hardware - Assembly • The production-ready version was ordered and assembled while the firmware was being completed • Features an SLA-printed outer enclosure, status LEDs, and magnet for wall-mounting.

Depending on which sensor is set off first, transit direction can be determined Threshold A B if (time(A) < time(B)) { people_in + 1; } else { people_out + 1;} Sensor 1 Sensor 2 Very Simplified Falling Edge Detection Algorithm ","Cellular IoT Algorithm Validation Prototyping Architectures Next Steps Alex Lomis 11 Cellular IoT Data Vis. Literature Review • Reliability is a serious concern with existing occupancy estimation systems • Cellular systems are reliable due to no dependency on complex communication or workmanship skills on site. • By using a microcontroller with a built-in 4G-LTE modem, we can operate independently of building Wi-Fi, and even operate through power losses ","Cellular IoT Algorithm Validation Prototyping Architectures Next Steps Alex Lomis 12 Cellular IoT - Architecture Data Vis. Literature Review • I don’t have the time to go into the full details of how our 4G system works • Very roughly, there exist two components of our system that are bridged by the cellular network • The local system reads the sensors and processes the raw data • The cloud system receives the processed information and publishes it to our visualization tools • This system allows for rapid prototyping through over-the-air updates • Applicable in other projects as well ","Data Vis.

Cellular IoT Algorithm Validation Prototyping Architectures Alex Lomis 14 Next Steps Literature Review The current People Counter design is only suitable for single entry rooms/buildings. Future designs will link sensors across a building • No current method exists for connecting sensor readings from multiple entryways and combining results • Connecting sensors will require a custom backend and server- side processing, or a “master-board” that downloads data from others in an area A more robust algorithm could be developed through the use of Machine Learning • The microcontroller that drives this system is capable of running simple machine learning libraries that could further strengthen the robustness of the counting methods ","Alex Lomis The funding provided by this microgrant helped make this project possible!
